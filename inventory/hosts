# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

#uncomment if run locally
#localhost ansible_connection=local

######   Always use IP address, since we don't nessarily have right DNS to resolve each host, this module it's assuming it's using IP
